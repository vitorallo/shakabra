# Spotify Audio Features API - 2025 Update

## Critical Finding: Audio Features Endpoint Status

### 1. Deprecation Status
Both audio-features endpoints are marked as **"Deprecated"** in the latest Spotify documentation:
- GET `/audio-features/{id}` - Single track audio features
- GET `/audio-features?ids={ids}` - Multiple tracks audio features

### 2. Required Scopes
**IMPORTANT**: The audio-features endpoints do NOT require any specific OAuth scope. They only require a valid access token. This is confirmed by reviewing the complete scopes documentation - these endpoints are not listed under any scope requirement.

### 3. 403 Forbidden Error Analysis

Getting 403 errors on ALL tracks (even globally available ones) indicates one of these issues:

1. **Invalid or Malformed Token**: The token might be corrupted or incorrectly formatted
2. **Token Type Issue**: Using the wrong type of token (e.g., app token instead of user token)
3. **Regional/Market Restrictions**: Some specific market restrictions we're not aware of
4. **API Deprecation**: The endpoints might be in process of being phased out
5. **Account Type Issue**: Despite having Premium, there might be account-specific restrictions

### 4. Test Results Summary
```json
{
    "accessTokenLength": 271,  // Token exists and has expected length
    "tokenPrefix": "BQA...",   // Correct Bearer token format
    "results": [
        // ALL tracks return 403, regardless of availability
        {"track": "Cut To The Feeling", "status": 403},
        {"track": "Mr. Brightside", "status": 403},
        {"track": "Shape of You", "status": 403},
        {"track": "bad guy", "status": 403},
        {"track": "Heat Waves", "status": 403}
    ]
}
```

### 5. Potential Solutions

#### A. Use Client Credentials Flow for Audio Features
The audio-features endpoint might work with app-only authentication (Client Credentials flow) rather than user authentication:

```javascript
// Get app token using Client Credentials
async function getAppToken() {
  const response = await fetch('https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
      'Authorization': `Basic ${Buffer.from(`${CLIENT_ID}:${CLIENT_SECRET}`).toString('base64')}`
    },
    body: 'grant_type=client_credentials'
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.access_token;
}
```

#### B. Alternative: Use Track Endpoint's Audio Features
Some track information might be available through the main tracks endpoint:
- GET `/tracks/{id}` - Returns basic track info
- GET `/tracks?ids={ids}` - Multiple tracks

#### C. Migration Path
Since the endpoints are deprecated, Spotify might be moving this functionality elsewhere:
1. Check if audio features are now included in track objects
2. Look for new recommendation endpoints that might include this data
3. Consider using the Recommendations API which still accepts audio feature parameters

### 6. Immediate Action Items

1. **Test with Client Credentials Token**: Try using app-only auth instead of user auth
2. **Check Token Validity**: Verify the token works with other endpoints
3. **Contact Spotify Support**: Since you have Premium and valid tokens, this might be a bug
4. **Implement Fallback**: Design the AI mixing to work without audio features if necessary

### 7. Code Changes Needed

```typescript
// In app/api/spotify/audio-features/route.ts
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    // Option 1: Try with app token
    const appToken = await getAppToken();
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-features?ids=${ids}`, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${appToken}`
      }
    });
    
    if (!response.ok && session?.accessToken) {
      // Option 2: Fallback to user token
      const userResponse = await fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-features?ids=${ids}`, {
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${session.accessToken}`
        }
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

The 403 errors on the audio-features endpoint despite having:
- Valid access token (confirmed by length and format)
- Premium account (confirmed by profile API)
- No specific scope requirements (per documentation)

...suggests either:
1. The deprecation is more advanced than documented
2. The endpoint now requires app-only (Client Credentials) authentication
3. There's an account-specific issue that needs Spotify support

The best immediate approach is to implement Client Credentials flow for audio-features while maintaining the current user auth for playback control.
